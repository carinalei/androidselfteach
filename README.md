resources used:
Outside of class for this self-learning assignment I primarily used the Android Developer website. 
http://developer.android.com/training/index.html


tutorials used:
I went through two of the main tutorials on developer website listed below:
  Building Your First App
      - Creating an Android Project
      - Running Your Application
      - Building a Simple User Interface
      - Starting Another Activity
  Adding the Action Bar
      - Setting Up the Action Bar
      - Adding Action Buttons
      

what the code does:
The code implements some of the fundamentals of Android app deisgn by building a simple user interface and managing user input. A user can enter a message, press a button, and the code will display the message on a second activity. The code also sets up the action bar which helps implement the app's activities.
